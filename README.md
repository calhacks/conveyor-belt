A Ruby script for converting HackerEarth project exports to the Hammer / Gavel CSV format.

Download the script, edit the configuration options, and then run it.

The script will output both a `projects.csv` and `judges.csv` (for use with [Hammer](https://github.com/calhacks/hammer)).

Copy & paste these files' contents into Hammer / Gavel.
